# Epic: OCCT Core â€” Geometry & Data Exchange

**Outcome:** Robust B-rep operations, tessellation, and STEP/IGES I/O with tests and WASM-ready build.

## Goals
- Boolean/feature/tessellation APIs.
- STEP/IGES round-trip tests with tolerances.
- WASM build via Emscripten and minimal bindings.

## Success metrics
- Native + WASM builds green in CI.
- STEP round-trips within tolerance on samples.
- Fuzz suite for booleans passing.
