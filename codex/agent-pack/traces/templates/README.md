# Agent Pack Trace Templates

Templates describing how to render Plan → Act → Verify → Summarize loops in client UIs.

## Planned Templates
- `desktop.json` — mapping trace steps to desktop action cards, including timing, warnings, artifacts, and consent state.
- `web.json` — simplified structure for browser viewer replays with tool call summaries.

Populate these files once the eval tracer shape is finalized.
