# Documentation & ADRs

## Requirements
- Every new module ships with a README (goal, API, examples).
- Architectural decisions recorded as ADRs under `/docs/adrs/`:
  - **Template**: Context → Decision → Options → Consequences.
- Keep `/codex/project_overview.md` updated when high-level boundaries change.

## Style
- Short, task-oriented docs with code blocks.
- Link to schemas and public APIs; avoid duplication.
