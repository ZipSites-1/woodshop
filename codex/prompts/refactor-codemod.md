# Prompt â€” Refactor / Codemod

Refactor safely without behavior change.

**Scope**
- Targets: {paths}
- Non-goals: API changes, feature work

**Steps**
1) Explain the refactor plan (bullets)
2) Apply codemod in small commits
3) Keep tests passing; add tests if coverage is lacking
4) Run formatters/linters

**Output**
- Diff summary + risk notes
